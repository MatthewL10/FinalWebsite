    <h2>Who are we?</h2>
    <p class="mainpage">
      FTC Team 731, Wannabee Strange has been around for 12 years and almost
      since the time FIRST Tech Challenge began. We have participated in various
      qualifier events all around North Carolina, showing great growth through
      our progression from these local qualifying competitions in NC to the
      World Championships. Our team has advanced time and time again to Worlds,
      where we place high and continue to grow together as a team. We also make
      an impact at the state, national and international level through our
      Varsity Letter Initiative and mentorship of teams, which we do through
      online platforms such as Discord.

      <p class="offset">
        Wannebee Strange, since its inception, has done countless amounts of
        outreach under ECG Robotics, giving demos of robots to various
        elementary students, inspiring them to pursue careers in the robotics
        field or perhaps join a robotics organization/club in the future. We
        also began pursuing more ambitious outreach goals through our Varsity
        Letter Initiative, attempting to provide every FTC team across North
        Carolina with resources to fuel their season. We have also mentored
        several local FLL teams, all of which have been very successful in their
        endeavors as they advance to the state level.
