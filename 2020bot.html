      <p id="whitefont" class="robotinfo">
        Custom drivtain built with water jet cut 1/4" aluminum plates and 4
        mecanum wheels, which allows for omnidirectional movement. The 1/4"
        aluminum creates a high strength, yet lightweight drivetrain because of
        the pocketing on the plates. The pocketing reduces weight while keeping
        as much strucutral integreiy as possible.

      <!-- <h2 class="smaller">V1 Bucket Arm</h2> -->
      <img class="centered" src="images/2020intake.png" />
      <p class="robotinfo">
        Compliant wheel intake. Built from 3d printed plates and soft grippy
        wheels to grab hold of plastic blocks. Each side is powered by one
        motor, so the intake has the strength of two motors to quickly and
        efficiently intake the game elements. Rubber bands are also attached to
        tension the two sides to be able to intake blocks from many different
        angles.

      <h2 class="smaller">Outtake mechanism</h2>
      <img class="centered" src="images/2020v4b.png" />
      <p class="robotinfo">
        This is a 3d printed virtual 4 bar linkage with a gripper attached to
        grab hold of field elements. It is powered by high torque servos, which
        allows for consistent and fast linkage movement. To assist the motors
        rubber bands are attached to fight gravuty and reduce the moment of
        force on the servos. Chains are used to create te virutal 4 bar linkage
        to constantly keep the gripper horizontal.

      <p class="robotinfo">
        This robot uses linear slides to give the robot verticle reach and to
        stack the game elements. The mecanum wheels allow the robot to quickly
        move around the field between robots and obstacles. The 3d printed
        intake allows the robot to quickly intake blocks no matter their
        orientation and position, which then moves to the gripper that is
        attached to virtual 4 bar on the verticle linear slides. The virtual 4
        bar linkage is then able to quickly extend out to outake the plastic
        blocks.
