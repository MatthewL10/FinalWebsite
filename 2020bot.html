        Our boxtube drivetrain allows for efficient interchangeability, mostly
        due to its sleeker design which combats traditional c-channels. In order
        to account for the 18”x18” constraint. The custom boxtube drivetrain
        creates more space for the intake, control and rev hubs, as well as a
        wobble goal mechanisms.

        The current version of our robot is built around a<b>
          custom 6-wheel treaded tank aluminum box-tube drivetrain that allows
          us to quickly move around the field—between and over the barrier—to
          cycle and play defense.</b
        >
        The big pulleys allow the belts to act as
        <b>treads when going over the barriers. </b>A single stage intake
        consisting of <b>surgical tubing</b> quickly intakes freight and
        transfers it to the <b>gripper</b>. The gripper
        <b>automatically</b> closes using a <b>color sensor</b> to prevent the
        freight from escaping; with the click of a button, the gripper passes
        through the robot to the needed scoring position through the use of our
        <b>double axis 2 degrees of freedom arm,</b> which alongside our
        gripper, allows us to cap our TSE. A motor connected to a compliant
        gecko wheel is attached to the upright box tube to spin the duck
        carousel. With a simple arm 2 DOF, the robot is both able to cycle the
        shared and team shipping hubs, as well as play defense when needed with
        its<b>6-wheel tank drive</b> and the ability to
        <b>overpower mecanum drivetrains</b>.
