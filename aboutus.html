          Hello, my name is Matthew Limanto. I am currently a junior at The
          Early College at Guilford, and this will be my fifth year
          participating in the FIRST program. During my FLL years I was mainly
          interested in mechanical engineering, however I am also interested in
          programming to gain more experience in other areas. I've learned a lot
          about building robots and different mechanical aspects of robots and
          as Mechanical Lead and captain, I will be able to do something I love
          with a team to help me along the way. In the future I plan on pursuing
          a career in robotics, and by joining FIRST, I can not only acquire
          more knowledge in robotics, but I will be able to impact future
          generations in a positive way.

          My name is Zain and I am a junior at the STEM Early College at NC A&T.
          This will be my fourth year participating in the FIRST program. During
          my FLL years, I was curious about the programming aspects of robotics,
          but I was also interested in learning more about mechanical
          engineering. I enjoy learning about aspects that regard the STEM
          field, so having a part on a robotics team enhances my understanding
          of subjects that I am fond of. By participating in FTC on team
          Wannabee Strange, my knowledge of engineering increases as well as my
          team building skills. In the future, I plan on applying my experiences
          from FIRST robotics on the path of electrical engineering and design
          processes.

          My name is Zoya Bawangaonwala. I am a senior at The Early College at
          Guilford, and this is my fourth year with ECG Robotics and fifth year
          as a part of the FIRST program. It is also my third year as the club's
          marketing lead. I think that being in robotics and delving into the
          design process could be a launchpad into a potential career in Graphic
          Design. As the head of marketing at ECG Robotics—the organization that
          team 731 is a part of—I help create a team image and connect with many
          other teams at competitions and team events. I hope that this role
          will help me push ECG Robotics' teams forward in their endeavors as a
          whole. I also aid in the design of our team's engineering notebook and
          apparel. I do my best to understand and contribute to all the elements
          that go into our robot, and I look forward to seeing where each season
          will take us as a team.

          I'm Robbie, and I'm a junior at The Early College at Guilford. This is
          my sixth year participating in a FIRST robotics program. I've been
          interested in engineering for most of my life and have been on several
          FLL teams in the past. I've learned a lot about building a competitive
          robot, more specifically about 3D design and building the robot. I see
          joining this team and future experiences with FIRST as a step into my
          future and a learning opportunity for a career I hope to pursue once
          I'm out of school. I've always been drawn to FIRST's vision and
          mission statement and have strong visions for my own future.

          apply it to an occupation in the STEM field. As my second year as the
          programming lead, I am very involved in the coding process. My passion
          lies in computer science and game design, and I believe that through
          involvement in the fields of technology, applied mathematics and even
          design, I can apply FIRST virtues to my future endeavors. I am
          particularly interested in exercise science and I think ECG Robotics
          and FIRST can provide me with a platform for a promising potential
          career in STEM.

          mathematics, and design, which is why I am excited to expand on these
          skills this year. After building hovercrafts in Science Olympiad and
          competing in Math club, I was inspired to join the ECG Robotics team
          Wannabee Strange as I want to combine my experience from previous
          clubs to enhance my knowledge of robotics and introduce myself to new
          concepts such as programming. I've always been fascinated with
          computer sciences, so learning from my team members this year will be
          exciting as I hope to take similar classes in college. As a math tutor
          for middle school students, I hope to challenge them with not only
          mathematics but interest them in all of the aspects of STEM. I can't
          wait to see what this year has in store for our team!

          robotics and competition, but I'm particularly interested in the
          programming side of FTC. While I've played around with simple block
          coding programs such as Scratch, I look forward to learning Java
          coding and applying the concepts I learn in a future career in STEM.
          Robotics is the perfect stepping stone to aerospace engineering, which
          I hope to pursue as an undergraduate student and as a career.

          solutions to different scientific issues. This is what sparked my
          interest in STEM, and it is the reason I plan to seek a profession in
          this field. I hope to use the knowledge I attain through FTC for
          future pursuits in computer programming. I also want to use this

          out the most efficient and consistent ways to get different tasks
          done. I feel that robotics would be a good way to strengthen my
          ability to do these things, which is a skill that will help me through
          the rest of my life. I also hope to meet new people and make new
          friends along the way. I am also excited to hear the different ideas
          and thoughts of other people with the same passion for robotics, and
          feel as though I am where I belong when on a team of robotics
          enthusiasts.
